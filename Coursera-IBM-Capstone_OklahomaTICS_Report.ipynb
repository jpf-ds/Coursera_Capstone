The geocoder will be used to plot the travel information centers. The radius is set fairly extensively so we encompass the entire state and find any TICs within that radius. \n\nI then pulled the data from Foursquare's Places API into a basic dataframe. There are several features within the dataframe that are not of any use, so I cleanse the dataframe and prep it for visualization. \n\nIn the final step, I visualize the dataframe and plot the travel information centers on a map to understand the spread of the dataframe. \n"

For returning tourists, more travel information centers would make for an excellent revenue-generating asset for the state and should be considered."
